        <title>First glimpse of hong kong</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been living in Hong Kong for more than 3 months now. Here are somethings that i feel unique about HK compared with other places i have lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is really wet. I used to live in Shanghai of China and several cities in east part of USA. I had a feeling that i am soaking in water during my first week’s stay here. As time went on, my body gradually got used to the himidity. But i have to be careful about things at home. Bags, clothes get mouldy and Food get rotten easily. Himidity is good for trees and plants though. I am able to grow something interesting at home like Nepenthes. It has leaves that look like traps to catch and kill flying insects. I used to imagine this kind of plant only lives in the tropical jungle lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong has a nice layout while it is not big and with one of the highest population densities in the world. I can have a convenient city life while living super close to the nature. I can have a walk along the sea bay every evening and go hiking in mountains during the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June I visited Tsz shan monastery. It is a chinese Buddhist monastery built and open to the public in the early 2015. The monastery is located in mountains and facing to the lake. I joined the walking meditation hosted by the monastery. We were guilded to complete a walk. What is unique is that we need to make very slow moves. Slow enough to feel each and every step and how our heart keep wandering here and there during walk. I also took some time to finish writing a calligraphy from ‘THE HEART OF PRAJNA PARAMITA SUTRA’. It tells you that form does not differ from emptiness and emptiness does not differ from form. It is a classic buddhist philosophy and I find it  pretty helpful for leading a joyful life in Hong Kong. It is easy to be stressed out to live in a city with fast pace and competition. While it is important to pursue personal sucess, it doen’t worth losing who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
